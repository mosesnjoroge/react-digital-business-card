      <h2>Info</h2>
      <p> I am a Junior Full-Stack Software Developer, recent graduate from Le Wagon's Web Development Coding Bootcamp. I have gone into a variety of fields such as; environmental conservation, event coordinator to name a few. If I was to describe how came about to be in love in coding, I would say I have taken the scenic route to the field I have always had an interest in. I'd describe myself as a person who is also curious and eager to learn, creative thinker always looking for efficiencies, and likes to take an initiative. I'm open to new opportunities and looking to utilise my previous experiences going forward in a new role as a web developer.</p>
